# HealthHub-App
The PDF includes the detailed outline of the HealthHub App project which includes the requirements, designs, implementations, and verifications for the app.
This application provides a platform in which users can create their own personalized
meal plans along with their own personalized workout plan to tackle their metabolic
syndrome. It also provides a forum where users can share best practices for losing
weight, eating healthily, and creating a healthier lifestyle. There is also a shop feature
that allows users to buy a meal prep subscription in which they would get personalized
meal prep meals to cook based on their personalized data. Having easy access to clear,
concise, and useful information about the userâ€™s data metrics can be very empowering
to the user. This app will empower the user with data specific to their body metrics. The
user will be able to correlate what activities or habits are having a positive impact on
mitigating the effects of Metabolic Syndrome and choose whether to adopt these
activities or habits into a long-term change in lifestyle
